# In this stimulus a spot is created at one edge of the screen, it moves towards the center and then turns into a linear loom
units: cm          # stimulus unit


# Square parameters
initial_pos: 0, 0   # Positions are defined in pixels
end_pos: 100, 100
size: 1            #  in cm
duration: 3000         # seconds

# Loom parameters
type: spot_loom          # type of stimulus
modality: linear    # loom expansion mode
repeats: 1          # Number of times the stimulus is repeated


# start_size: 0.5     # start size is the size of the spot
end_size: 3         # end size, in unit specified below
expand_time: 500    # duration of expansion in ms
on_time: 250       # for how long the stim stays on after it finished expanding
# pos: 0, 0           # loom position is now the end position of the spot
