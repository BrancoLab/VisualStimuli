# In this stimulus a spot is created at one edge of the screen, it moves towards the center and then turns into a linear loom
units: deg          # stimulus unit


# Square parameters
initial_pos: -2000, -1000   # Positions are defined in pixels
end_pos: 100, 100
size: 5            #  in cm
duration: 4000         # seconds

# Loom parameters
type: spot_loom          # type of stimulus
modality: linear    # loom expansion mode
repeats: 1          # Number of times the stimulus is repeated


# start_size: 0.5     # start size is the size of the spot
end_size: 30         # end size, in unit specified below
expand_time: 500    # duration of expansion in ms
on_time: 250       # for how long the stim stays on after it finished expanding
# pos: 0, 0           # loom position is now the end position of the spot
