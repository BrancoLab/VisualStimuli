type: grating

spatial frequency: 0.25   # If units == ‘deg’ or ‘cm’ units are in cycles per deg or cm as appropriate.
bg color: 'wnd'        # if set as 'wnd' it will be the same color as the window bg, otherwise can be value in range 0-255
fg color: 255          # color of foreground
orientation: 0         # orientation in degs relative to the screen
direction: 0           # 0 or 1, direction of movement [opposite directions knowing the orientation]
velocity:  2           # Velocity in phases per second. Actual velocity depends on spatial frequency. smaller sf results in larger vel
duration:  2000        # duration in ms


units: deg              # Unit of measurement
