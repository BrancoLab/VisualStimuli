type: grating

spatial frequency: 0.25   # If units == ‘deg’ or ‘cm’ units are in cycles per deg or cm as appropriate.
fg color: 255          # color of foreground
orientation: 90         # orientation in degs relative to the screen. Orientation convention is like a clock:
                       # 0 is vertical, and positive values rotate clockwise. Beyond 360 and below zero values wrap appropriately.
direction: -1           # -1 or 1, direction of movement [opposite directions knowing the orientation]
velocity:  2           # Velocity in phases per second. Actual velocity depends on spatial frequency. smaller sf results in larger vel
duration:  2000        # duration in ms


units: deg              # Unit of measurement
